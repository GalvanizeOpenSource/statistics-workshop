# Statistics Workshop

As part of the application process for Galvanize's Data Science Immersive program, you'll receive a take-home exercise and have two interviews with Galvanize faculty, one to assess your skills in Python, and another to evaluate your skills in statistics, math, and probability.

This workshop surveys the concepts in probability and statistics that are covered in the second interview.

## Things You Should Bring

You should bring the following:

- Notebook
- Pencils and/or pens

We will be pausing often to allow people to work through problems, and then discussing them as a class.  It is important that you attempt these problems, as this will give you a good foundation of practice when you move on to practicing on your own.
